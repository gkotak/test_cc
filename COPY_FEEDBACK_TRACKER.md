| T3-53 | Originally from Birmingham, Mthr Clemency discerned her call to ordained ministry while at university. She began her ministry in West Hampstead in May 2026, with a particular responsibility for the life and ministry of St Cuthbert’s Church, alongside a focus on developing passion for social justice and community outreach across our two churches. Mthr Clemency is currently training as a spiritual director in the Ignatian tradition and has a particular love for contemplative prayer. Outside of ministry, she enjoys reading good books and watching bad television, and can usually be drawn into a conversation about tennis or hymns. | ✅ Changed<br>*Sanity person (Clemency)* | [our-team.html](https://emmanuel-website-sepia.vercel.app/ui_kits/website/our-team.html) |
| T3-54 | St Cuthbert’s  <br>  <br>  St Cuthbert’s is a church entering an exciting new chapter. After a period where regular worship was paused, we are preparing to re-root ourselves in regular prayer and worship. Like Emmanuel, we seek to make the Eucharist at the heart of everything we do: a shared meal which reflects our shared lives together.  <br>  We hope for services at St Cuthbert’s to take a more informal shape, bringing together ancient traditions of worship with a warm and accessible atmosphere.  <br>  Alongside this, St Cuthbert’s has become a thriving centre of community life. A growing range of projects and events make the church building a place of welcome throughout the week, including Saturday’s FoodCycle community lunches (the largest in London!), our local Scouts group, a repair café, and other social outreach initiatives. At St Cuthbert’s, worship and community life grow side by side. | ✅ Changed<br>*`st-cuthberts.njk`; About Us → St Cuthbert’s Church* | [st-cuthberts.html](https://emmanuel-website-sepia.vercel.app/ui_kits/website/st-cuthberts.html) |
| T3-55 | A lifelong resident of West Hampstead, Claire has been a familiar face in our community for years, having taught Sunday school for over 18 years. As Children’s Champion, she brings a deep understanding of our local families, especially since many of the children attend the church-connected school where she also works. Claire loves seeing the children grow in confidence and faith across both school and church life. In her rare moments of free time, she enjoys relaxing with friends, getting lost in a good book, or catching a live concert. | ✅ Changed<br>*Sanity person (Claire)* | [our-team.html](https://emmanuel-website-sepia.vercel.app/ui_kits/website/our-team.html) |
| T3-56 | Antony Edwards  <br>  Antony has lived in West Hampstead with his family for over 20 years having previously lived in Australia, New York, and Switzerland. As one of the churchwardens, he helps oversee the practical and financial aspects of parish life, while also supporting the Church’s mission and ministry. He has a particular interest in the rich variety of Christian traditions, interfaith engagement, and how faith can shape everyday life for the better. He’s also always happy to talk about cricket. | ✅ Changed<br>*Sanity person (Antony; was “To be confirmed”)* | [our-team.html](https://emmanuel-website-sepia.vercel.app/ui_kits/website/our-team.html) |

| T2-44 | I think we don’t need the 15k thing twice? | ✅ Changed<br>*Home support copy — dropped “£15,000 a month” sentence; kept £15k figure* | [index.html](https://emmanuel-website-sepia.vercel.app/ui_kits/website/index.html) |

| T2-55 | Needs to be bigger, same as the other headers  <br>  <br>  Also the images feel giant? I think a bit smaller would be okay but it takes ages to scroll and it should at least include an email address where the team can be reached | ⏸️ Needs review | — |
| T2-56 | I think it’d be better if we have one of these that stay consistent. | ✅ Changed<br>*History callout: single tan “Plan a visit” button* | [history.html](https://emmanuel-website-sepia.vercel.app/ui_kits/website/history.html) |

| T2-66 | I think we can remove the other service times because they’re not all for kids  <br>  Also add scouts and youth group? | ⏸️ I think they are for kids | — |
| T2-67 | I think (considering we’re focussing on children) these two deserve a similar box to Children’s and Youth Church.  <br>  I think it’s good we mention our child bishop but it feels a bit useless, @Trin maybe a picture on our board rather than online? | ⏸️ Too big a change, not doing now | — |
| T2-68 | Maybe add a picture? | ⏸️ Needs review | — |
| T2-69 | Maybe include a link to the events page here  <br>  And maybe info about children’s choir and the youth club? | ⏸️ Needs review | — |

| T2-71 | I think Joe should move to the “Our Team” page and this could maybe be a link? Feels silly to have them double | ✅ Changed<br>*Music page links to Our Team; Joseph Verdin added via CMS (was Youth Worker placeholder)* | [music.html](https://emmanuel-website-sepia.vercel.app/ui_kits/website/music.html), [our-team.html](https://emmanuel-website-sepia.vercel.app/ui_kits/website/our-team.html) |
| T2-72 | Specify adult choir and add children? | ⏸️ Needs review | — |

## Sanity note

CMS updates applied via `studio/apply-feedback-june10.js`. Re-run Eleventy (`npm run dev` / `npm run build`) so the site refetches.
